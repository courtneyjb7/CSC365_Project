    * `character_id`: the internal id of the character. Can be used to query the

    * `character`: The name of the character.
    * `movie`: The movie the character is from.
    * `gender`: The gender of the character.
    * `top_conversations`: A list of characters that the character has the most
      conversations with. The characters are listed in order of the number of
      lines together. These conversations are described below.

    Each conversation is represented by a dictionary with the following keys:
    * `character_id`: the internal id of the character.
    * `character`: The name of the character.
    * `gender`: The gender of the character.
