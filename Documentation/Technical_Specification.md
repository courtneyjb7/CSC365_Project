# Technical Specification

## User Stories

As a trainer, I want to be the only one who is able to view and update my schedule.

As a trainer, when setting my schedule, I want to be able to select a type of class and set the time I will be teaching it. 

As a trainer, there are one or more types of classes that I can teach.

As a trainer, when I have to cancel a class, I want emails to be sent to the clients that were planning to attend, and money to be refunded.

As a trainer, I want to be able to view important information about a dog attending my class, and update notes on the dog’s progress.

As a dog owner/customer, I do not have access to these endpoints because the API is made for the dog trainers.

## Edge cases and transaction flows

If a dog does not attend a class, we will send an email reminder to the dog owner’s email.

If it is necessary to remove a dog from a class, for example, if the owner called to cancel, a trainer can remove them from the class.

If an owner changes their email information, then it will be updated in the dog’s information.

If a trainer cancels a class, an email is sent to each dog owner that was planning to attend.

If a trainer adds a class, its date and time are checked with all the other classes in the database. If the time conflicts with another class, 
an HTTPException is returned and the class cannot be added.  

If a trainer attempts to access a class, dog, schedule, etc. with an ID that does not exist, an HTTPException is returned.

If a trainer attempts to access a schedule or other trainer information that does not belong to them, it will result in an HTTPException.
